# Ojective
1) What were the MSSP results for each year from 2013 through 2020?
2) For each year, what are the assignment eligible beneficiary counts by county and proportion of these beneficiaries that were assigned to a MSSP ACO? How does this aggregate to the state level?
3) How have per beneficiary expenditure trends (normalized for risk score and beneficiary enrollment type) for areas with high ACOs penetration compared to areas with low ACO penetration? (We recommend using the “assignment eligible population” trends to answer this question, rather than the trends for all Medicare beneficiaries.)
4) Based on these results, what are your conclusions about financial benefits and costs of MSSP, what organizations are participating in and benefiting from MSSP, and to what extent MSSP has reduced costs for the Medicare program and US taxpayers?
